## Clients

Nakadi does not ship with a client, but there are some open source clients available that you can try:

| Name            | Language/Framework     |  GitHub    |
|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| Nakadi Klients  | Scala & Java | https://github.com/zalando/nakadi-klients |
| Reactive Nakadi | Scala/Akka   | https://github.com/zalando/reactive-nakadi |
| Fahrschein      | Java         | https://github.com/zalando-incubator/fahrschein |
| Straw           | Java         | https://github.com/zalando-incubator/straw |

We'll add more clients to this section as they appear. Nakadi doesn't support these clients; issues and pull requests should be filed with the client project.
