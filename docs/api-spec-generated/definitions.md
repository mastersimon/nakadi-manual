## Definitions

<a name="authorizationattribute"></a>
### AuthorizationAttribute
An attribute for authorization. This object includes a data type, which represents the type of the attribute
attribute (which data types are allowed depends on which authorization plugin is deployed, and how it is
configured), and a value. A wildcard can be represented with data type '*', and value '*'. It means that all
authenticated users are allowed to perform an operation.

<a name="event"></a>
### Event
**Note** The Event definition will be externalized in future versions of this document.

A basic payload of an Event. The actual schema is dependent on the information configured for
the EventType, as is its enforcement (see POST /event-types). Setting of metadata properties
are dependent on the configured enrichment as well.

For explanation on default configurations of validation and enrichment, see documentation of
`EventType.category`.

For concrete examples of what will be enforced by Nakadi see the objects BusinessEvent and
DataChangeEvent below.

*Type* : object


<a name="eventmetadata"></a>
### EventMetadata
Metadata for this Event.

Contains commons fields for both Business and DataChange Events. Most are enriched by Nakadi
upon reception, but they in general MIGHT be set by the client.


|Name|Description|Schema|
|---|---|---|
|**eid**  <br>*required*|Identifier of this Event.<br><br>Clients MUST generate this value and it SHOULD be guaranteed to be unique from the<br>perspective of the producer. Consumers MIGHT use this value to assert uniqueness of<br>reception of the Event.  <br>**Example** : `"105a76d8-db49-4144-ace7-e683e8f4ba46"`|string (uuid)|
|**event_type**  <br>*optional*|The EventType of this Event. This is enriched by Nakadi on reception of the Event<br>based on the endpoint where the Producer sent the Event to.<br><br>If provided MUST match the endpoint. Failure to do so will cause rejection of the<br>Event.  <br>**Example** : `"pennybags.payment-business-event"`|string|
|**flow_id**  <br>*optional*|The flow-id of the producer of this Event. As this is usually a HTTP header, this is<br>enriched from the header into the metadata by Nakadi to avoid clients having to<br>explicitly copy this.  <br>**Example** : `"JAh6xH4OQhCJ9PutIV_RYw"`|string|
|**occurred_at**  <br>*required*|Timestamp of creation of the Event generated by the producer.  <br>**Example** : `"1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00"`|string (date-time)|
|**parent_eids**  <br>*optional*||< string (uuid) > array|
|**partition**  <br>*optional*|Indicates the partition assigned to this Event.<br><br>Required to be set by the client if partition strategy of the EventType is<br>'user_defined'.  <br>**Example** : `"0"`|string|
|**received_at**  <br>*optional*  <br>*read-only*|Timestamp of the reception of the Event by Nakadi. This is enriched upon reception of<br>the Event.<br>If set by the producer Event will be rejected.  <br>**Example** : `"1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00"`|string (date-time)|
|**version**  <br>*optional*  <br>*read-only*|Version of the schema used for validating this event. This is enriched upon reception.<br>This string uses semantic versioning, which is better defined in the `EventTypeSchema` object.|string|


<a name="eventstreambatch"></a>
### EventStreamBatch
One chunk of events in a stream. A batch consists of an array of `Event`s plus a `Cursor`
pointing to the offset of the last Event in the stream.

The size of the array of Event is limited by the parameters used to initialize a Stream.

If acting as a keep alive message (see `GET /event-type/{name}/events`) the events array will
be omitted.

Sequential batches might present repeated cursors if no new events have arrived.

|**events**  <br>*optional*|< [Event](definitions.md#event) > array|
|**info**  <br>*optional*|[StreamInfo](definitions.md#streaminfo)|


<a name="eventtype"></a>
### EventType
An event type defines the schema and its runtime properties.


|Name|Description|Schema|
|---|---|---|
|**authorization**  <br>*optional*||[EventTypeAuthorization](definitions.md#eventtypeauthorization)|
|**category**  <br>*required*|Defines the category of this EventType.<br><br>The value set will influence, if not set otherwise, the default set of<br>validations, enrichment-strategies, and the effective schema for validation in<br>the following way:<br><br>- `undefined`: No predefined changes apply. The effective schema for the validation is<br>  exactly the same as the `EventTypeSchema`.<br><br>- `data`: Events of this category will be DataChangeEvents. The effective schema during<br>  the validation contains `metadata`, and adds fields `data_op` and `data_type`. The<br>  passed EventTypeSchema defines the schema of `data`.<br><br>- `business`: Events of this category will be BusinessEvents. The effective schema for<br>  validation contains `metadata` and any additionally defined properties passed in the<br>  `EventTypeSchema` directly on top level of the Event. If name conflicts arise, creation<br>  of this EventType will be rejected.|enum (undefined, data, business)|
|**compatibility_mode**  <br>*optional*|Compatibility mode provides a mean for event owners to evolve their schema, given changes respect the<br>semantics defined by this field.<br><br>It's designed to be flexible enough so that producers can evolve their schemas while not<br>inadvertently breaking existent consumers.<br><br>Once defined, the compatibility mode is fixed, since otherwise it would break a predefined contract,<br>declared by the producer.<br><br>List of compatibility modes:<br><br>- 'compatible': Consumers can reliably parse events produced under different versions. Every event published<br>  since the first version is still valid based on the newest schema. When in compatible mode, it's allowed to<br>  add new optional properties and definitions to an existing schema, but no other changes are allowed.<br>  Under this mode, the following json-schema attributes are not supported: `not`, `patternProperties`,<br>  `additionalProperties` and `additionalItems`. When validating events, additional properties is `false`.<br><br>- 'forward': Compatible schema changes are allowed. It's possible to use the full json schema specification<br>  for defining schemas. Consumers of forward compatible event types can safely read events tagged with the<br>  latest schema version as long as they follow the robustness principle.<br><br>- 'none': Any schema modification is accepted, even if it might break existing producers or consumers. When<br>  validating events, no additional properties are accepted unless explicitly stated in the schema.  <br>**Default** : `"forward"`|string|
|**created_at**  <br>*optional*|Date and time when this event type was created.  <br>**Pattern** : `"date-time"`|string|
|**default_statistic**  <br>*optional*||[EventTypeStatistics](definitions.md#eventtypestatistics)|
|**enrichment_strategies**  <br>*optional*|Determines the enrichment to be performed on an Event upon reception. Enrichment is<br>performed once upon reception (and after validation) of an Event and is only possible on<br>fields that are not defined on the incoming Event.<br><br>For event types in categories 'business' or 'data' it's mandatory to use<br>metadata_enrichment strategy. For 'undefined' event types it's not possible to use this<br>strategy, since metadata field is not required.<br><br>See documentation for the write operation for details on behaviour in case of unsuccessful<br>enrichment.|< enum (metadata_enrichment) > array|
|**name**  <br>*required*|Name of this EventType. The name is constrained by a regular expression.<br><br>Note: the name can encode the owner/responsible for this EventType and ideally should<br>follow a common pattern that makes it easy to read and understand, but this level of<br>structure is not enforced. For example a team name and data type can be used such as<br>'acme-team.price-change'.  <br>**Pattern** : `"[a-zA-Z][-0-9a-zA-Z_]*(\\.[a-zA-Z][-0-9a-zA-Z_]*)*"`  <br>**Example** : `"order.order_cancelled, acme-platform.users"`|string|
|**options**  <br>*optional*||[EventTypeOptions](definitions.md#eventtypeoptions)|
|**owning_application**  <br>*required*|Indicator of the (Stups) Application owning this `EventType`.  <br>**Example** : `"price-service"`|string|
|**partition_key_fields**  <br>*optional*|Required when 'partition_resolution_strategy' is set to 'hash'. Must be absent otherwise.<br>Indicates the fields used for evaluation the partition of Events of this type.<br><br>If this is set it MUST be a valid required field as defined in the schema.|< string > array|
|**partition_strategy**  <br>*optional*|Determines how the assignment of the event to a partition should be handled.<br><br>For details of possible values, see GET /registry/partition-strategies.  <br>**Default** : `"random"`|string|
|**read_scopes**  <br>*optional*|This field is used for event consuming access control. Nakadi only authorises consumers whose session<br>contains at least one of the scopes in this list.<br>If no scopes provided then anyone can consume from this event type.<br><br>Usage of read_scopes is deprecated.|< string > array|
|**schema**  <br>*required*||[EventTypeSchema](definitions.md#eventtypeschema)|
|**updated_at**  <br>*optional*|Date and time when this event type was last updated.  <br>**Pattern** : `"date-time"`|string|
|**write_scopes**  <br>*optional*|This field is used for event publishing access control. Nakadi only authorises publishers whose session<br>contains at least one of the scopes in this list.<br>If no scopes provided then anyone can publish to this event type.<br><br>Usage of write_scopes is deprecated.|< string > array|
